## About the Project

- Logos are designed for **dark backgrounds**. Some may not be suitable for light backgrounds.  
- If a logo seems invisible on GitHub (white background), right-click it and select **Copy image address** to use the URL directly.  
- New logos are added regularly.  
- Donators get priority logo requests, including custom/light-background versions.  
- All logos are in PNG format, 512px wide. Contact for other sizes.  
- Includes US local networks and international broadcasters.  
- Donations help speed up logo creation and maintenance.  
- Free for personal use; please credit this project if redistributing.  
- Logos are trademarked by their owners; this project offers lawful-use convenience.  
- Contact me to remove/change logos or submit your own.  
- Future plans include adding SVG logos.  
- Direct linking to RAW URLs is supported but not guaranteed stable.  
- Logo updates automatically propagate via direct links but may require cache clearing.  
- Contact me before linking logos to your services.  
- Found issues? Email: tapio.sinnertwin(at)gmail.com.

## Naming Convention

- Filenames are lowercase: `[channel-name][optional-number]-[country-code].png`  
- Spaces replaced with dashes `-`.  
- Local network call signs or city/region names included before country code if needed.

**Examples:**  
`abc-7-koat-us.png` | `discovery-channel-us.png` | `syfy-br.png` | `fox-crime-it.png` | `kanal-5-se.png`

- Time-delayed channels include `"plus"`, e.g. `challenge-plus-uk.png`.  
- Australia +2 hour channels example: `fox-hits-plus-2-au.png`.  
- Ampersands `&` replaced with `and`, e.g. `a-and-e-us.png`.  
- For unaffiliated/local stations: e.g. `7-news-miami-wsvn-us.png`.  
- Include dashes when searching for better results: `channel-4` instead of `channel 4`.  
- Horizontal logos include `"hz"` in the filename, e.g. `bbc-world-news-hz-uk.png`.
